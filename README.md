# Embe Bot
A quick and simple Python bot I created that utilizes services such as vxtwitter, vxtiktok, and ddinstagram in one bot to properly embed media for the user.
# How it works

Rather than re-inventing the wheel and creating a way to fix embeds on Discord for every major social media site -- I opted to automate the manual way of using these aforementioned services so it is done for you.

## Simply Paste your link and send.

Just post a link from either twitter.com, x.com, tiktok.com, instagram.com (reels only for now), and Embe Bot will detect it and reply to the original message with the converted link.
